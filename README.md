This is a repository for testing possible web/infrastructure solutions related to the University of Michigan's Collaborative Laboratory for Advancing Work in Space. More specifically, the Lab needs a good backend system for sending data to and from NASA, and you'll see me poking at stuff here.

## :earth_americas: Run TSS Server
1. Clone the repository...
```
git clone https://github.com/SUITS-Techteam/TSS-2025.git
```
2. Navigate into the root of the repository
7. To build the TSS Server, run...\
On Linux or WSL, this will require the C compiler gcc.
```
./build.bat
```
You can also use the [Visual Studio build tools](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/build/walkthrough-compile-a-c-program-on-the-command-line?view=msvc-170) to compile with
```
./buildvs.bat
```


4. To run the TSS Server, run ...
```
./server.exe
```
You should see the following lines appear...
```
Hello World

Launching Server at IP: 192.168.51.109:14141
Configuring Local Address...
Creating Socket...
Binding Socket...
Listening...
```
To run the server on local host (which might be useful if using WSL) run the following command
```
./server.exe --local
```
You should see the following lines appear...
```
Hello World

Launching Server at IP: 127.0.0.1:14141
Configuring Local Address...
Creating Socket...
Binding Socket...
Listening...
```

5. Type the IP address printed by the server into a web browser (Replace with your IP)\
Make sure you are on the same network as the server when connecting to it.
```
http://192.168.51.109:14141
```
6. From this website, you can interact with the TSS.\
This is where you can monitor the state of the server, verify the display of your system, and virtually interact with the EVA devices like you will be doing in May.

## TSS Files

* Server.c: contains the main function with a loop that processes HTTP messages and simulates data in the backend.
* Network.c: contains helper functions for the server to communicate with other devices.
* Server_data.c: contains the data that the server maintains and how that data is updated.
* public folder: contains a frontend for testing your device with TSS, along with all the json files that you will need from the server.

This server is based on "Network Programming in C" and builds off of the HTTPs example.

## UDP Socket communication

Commincation with the TSS is done via a UDP socket. To request data, send a message in the following format, all in big endian:

| Timestamp (unit32) | Command number (uint32) | 
| ------------------ | ----------------------- | 
| 4 bytes            | 4 bytes                 |

The timestamp is a UNIX timestamp, and the command numbers will be covered below. The socket will respond with a message of the following format:

| Timestamp (unit32) | Command number (uint32) | Output Data (variable)  |
| ------------------ | ----------------------- | ------------ |
| 4 bytes            | 4 bytes                 | 4 bytes      |

The command number will be the same one you sent, and the output data will either be an int32 or a float depending on the requested data. 

Note the one exception to the above output is the PR's LIDAR data, which will instead return 13 floats for it's output data. This will be explained further below. 

Here's a list of get commands you can send to the socket. They are mostly related to the json files in `public/json_data`, and will be listed as such. The command number order will match the order of data in the json file. 
| Command number | Command                       | Referenced .json file|
| -------------- | -------                       | --------- 
| 2-7            | Get EVA1 DCU switch states    | `DCU.json` |
| 8-13           | Get EVA2 DCU switch states    | `DCU.json` |
| 14-16          | Get ERROR states             | `ERROR.json` |
| 17-19          | Get EVA1 IMU states             | `IMU.json` |
| 20-22         | Get EVA2 IMU states             | `IMU.json` |

| 42-52        | Get EVA 2 SPEC states (excludes `name` field)              | `SPEC.json` |
| 53-62        | Get UIA states             | `UIA.json` |
| 63        | Get current EVA time for the team number passed in the data field as a float            | `/teams/x/TELEMTRY.json` |
| 64-85        | Get TELEMETRY states for EVA1 and the team number passed in the data field as a float            | `/teams/x/TELEMTRY.json` |
| 86-107        | Get TELEMETRY states for EVA1 and the team number passed in the data field as a float            | `/teams/x/TELEMTRY.json` |
| 108-123        | Get EVA states for the team number passed in the data field as a float            | `/teams/x/EVA.json` |
| 124-171        | Get Pressurized Rover states for the team currently running the PR sim | `/teams/x/ROVER_TELEMETRY.json` |
| 172        | Get Pressurized Rover LIDAR data, explaned below | `/teams/x/ROVER_TELEMETRY.json` |

## Pressurized Rover LIDAR
The pressurized rover in the DUST simulation has 13 'LIDAR' sensors. Each of these sensors are points that shoot out a ray 10 meters in a direction.The value of each sensor will be the distance in centimeters the ray took to hit something, or -1 if it didn't hit anything. The return data of the 172 command above will actually be a list of 13 float values instead of the normal 1 float. Here is a description of each sensor in order:

| Sensor index | Unreal Sensor Coordinates                |  Sensor location description | Sensor Orientation |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- | ------------------ |
| 0            | (X=170.000000,Y=-150.000000,Z=15.000000) | Hub of the front left wheel | Yawed 30 degrees left (CCW) of vehicle forward | 
| 1            | (X=200.000000,Y=-40.000000,Z=20.000000) | Front left of vehicle frame | Yawed 20 degrees left (CCW) of vehicle forward |

| 6            | (X=200.000000,Y=40.000000,Z=20.000000) | Front right of vehicle frame | Pitched 25 degrees down of vehicle forward |

## Pressurized Rover Commanding

Commanding the PR is done through the same socket connection, using the following command format:

| Timestamp (unit32) | Command number (uint32) | Input Data (float)  |
| ------------------ | ----------------------- | ------------ |
| 4 bytes            | 4 bytes                 | 4 bytes      |

The timestamp is a UNIX timestamp, and all data is in big endian. Here are the command numbers you will use for commanding the rover:

| Command number | Command     | Data input     |
| -------------- | -------     | ---------      |
| 1107           | Brakes      | float: 0 or 1    |
| 1109           | Throttle    | float: -100, 100 |
| 1110           | Steering    | float: -1.0, 1.0 |
| 1106           | Lights      | float:  0 or 1   |
